# HTML 

#### What is HTML?
    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
    HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
    HTML elements are represented by tags
    HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page


```
    <html>
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
       <title>repl.it</title>
       <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>use this for title</h1>
       <p>user this for pragraphe</p>
     </body>
   </html>
```
